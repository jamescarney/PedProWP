##Need to Fix

There are a few things that I want to fix. Some of them are about SEO and figuring out the best keywords to use, and others are about making the website work better.

###SEO

Do research about longtail keywords. We need to compete with Pedigree for our main keyword. That is going to be hard because they are a close to billion dollar company selling something for dogs. Not anything horse related. So I need to find some longtail keywords that are more relevant, because most people who are searching for those keywords are looking for food, not for us.

* Thoroughbred horse pedigrees
* Horse sale catalogue
